OpenAQ is an environmental tech nonprofit. We aggregate and harmonize open air quality data from across the globe onto an open-source, open-access data platform so that anyone concerned about air quality has unfettered access to the data they need to analyze, communicate and advocate for clean air. By providing universal access to air quality data, OpenAQ empowers a global community of changemakers to solve air inequalityâ€“the unequal access to clean air.
