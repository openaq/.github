# LLM Policy

OpenAQ is a small team working on a relatively large and complex codebase. The
OpenAQ platform serves millions of requests daily and provides essential access
to air quality data. The platform’s reliability and long term viability is
central to our mission of providing universal access to air quality data.
Intentional and carefully written code makes the OpenAQ platform successful and
sustainable.

When contributing code to any of the OpenAQ open-source projects, contributors
must disclose any use of LLMs. Disclosing the use of LLMs in code contributions
will help provide important context for the review process. As part of the
review of contributions it is important that contributors have a clear
understanding of the code they contribute. Code written by LLMs may obscure the
contributor’s understanding and intentions and in turn make contributions harder
to review and assess. Contributions wholly written using an LLM are unlikely to
be accepted, but may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
